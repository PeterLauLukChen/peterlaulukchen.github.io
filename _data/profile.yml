  <p>
    I am an undergradute student from Columbia, advised by Prof. <a href="https://ajblumberg.github.io/">Andrew Blumberg</a> and Prof. <a href="https://tydlin.github.io/">Tianyi Lin</a>. I am working closely with Columbia Geometric Data Analysis Group.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interest broadly lies in the intersection of Machine Learning (LLM Pre/Post Training, Deep Generative Models), Optimization (Convex & Non-convex & Non-Smooth & Zeroth-Order Optimization, Optimal Transport), and Geometric Data Analysis (Manifold Learning, Topological Data Analysis). 
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, my works are focusing on LLM Alignment & Preference Optimization, LLM Reasoning, Zeroth-Order Optimization, and Geometry Processing. My research is partially supported by HKU-IDS Research Grant.
